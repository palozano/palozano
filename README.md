- 👋 Hi, I’m Pablo!
- 👀 I’m interested in (mainly) Rust, but also Typescript.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things, to be honest.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on \*cool\* (web or not, preferably open source) projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Drop me a DM on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/palozano4).
