- 👋 Hi, I’m Pablo!
- 👀 I’m interested in (mainly) Rust, but also Typescript, Python, R, and a bit of C++, too.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning cryptography and good software architecture.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on \*cool\* (web or not, but preferably open source) projects.
- 📫 How to reach me? Drop me a DM on [Mastodon](https://mas.to/@palozano).
